# Hi, I'm Kesavan

## About Me  
Iâ€™m a developer with expertise across **Android, Python, Rust, and Containers**.  
I work on both **system-level engineering** (Android ROMs, kernels, low-level tooling) and **application development** (cross-platform apps, backend APIs, automation).  

I believe in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code while focusing on performance and scalability.
